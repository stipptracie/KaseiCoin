# KaseiCoin - Martian Token Crowdsale

In this project, I created a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant and that is minted by using a `Crowdsale` contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

The crowdsale contract manages the entire crowdsale process, allowing users to send ether to the contract and in return receive KSC, or KaseiCoin tokens. The contract will mint the tokens automatically and distribute them to buyers in one transaction.

Remix was used to write, compile, and deploy this test project. (https://remix-project.org/)
